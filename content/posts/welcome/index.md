Welcome to my corner of the internet where I document my journey through the world of application security.

## What to Expect

This blog is where I'll be sharing:

- **Security Research** - Deep dives into vulnerabilities I've discovered, interesting attack vectors, and exploitation techniques
- **CTF Writeups** - Solutions and walkthroughs from TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and other CTF competitions
- **Tool Building** - Security automation scripts and tooling I've built to make vulnerability hunting more efficient
- **Threat Modeling** - Approaches to identifying and mapping attack surfaces in modern applications

## A Bit About Me

I'm an Application Security Engineer at Zoho, where I spend my days (and sometimes nights) hunting bugs in web, cloud, and iOS applications. Over the past 3 years, I've assessed hundreds of applications, built security tooling, and designed CTF challenges for internal training events.

I'm also active in the bug bounty community on HackerOne and Bugcrowd, and I regularly sharpen my skills on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox.

## Why This Blog?

Security knowledge should be shared. Every vulnerability found, every technique learned, and every tool built can help others in the community become better at what we do. This blog is my way of giving back and documenting what I learn along the way.

If you're into security, feel free to stick around. And if you want to connect or collaborate, check out the [About](/about/) page for my contact details.

Let's break things responsibly.
