Hey there! I'm Joel, an Application Security Engineer at Zoho Corporation, where I've spent the past 3 years hunting security vulnerabilities in web, cloud, and iOS applications used by millions of people.

## What I Do

My day-to-day involves a mix of manual vulnerability testing, code reviews, and building security tooling. I've assessed over 110 applications, led threat modeling sessions, and designed CTF challenges for internal security training events. There's something deeply satisfying about finding that one bug that everyone else missed.

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and security right now - using LLMs to automate security workflows and poking at AI-powered systems to see how they break.

## Skills & Tools

On the security side, I work across penetration testing, mobile security (especially iOS), API security, cloud security (AWS/GCP), and threat modeling using STRIDE and PASTA frameworks.

My toolkit includes Burp Suite, Frida, Objection, Metasploit, MobSF, Nmap, sqlmap, Nuclei, and OWASP ZAP. For programming, I mostly write in Python and Bash, with some Java, JavaScript, and C when needed.

## Bug Bounties & CTFs

I'm active on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/r00tski11) and [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/h/Joel-sam), and I regularly solve challenges on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/r00tski11d) and [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/public/users/1926265).

Currently working towards my OSCP certification.

## Research & Publications

I published a research paper at the 2023 IEEE ICCCIS conference on [Mitigating the Security Risks of Browser Extensions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10169483) - focusing on real-time detection of malicious browser extensions.

## Education

B.Tech in Computer Science from Karunya Institute of Technology, Coimbatore (2019-2023).
